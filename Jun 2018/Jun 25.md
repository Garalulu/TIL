## 26 - 1. Past, Present, and Future

Welcome to unit 7. This unit will start with a brief summary of the course, recapping the major themes we've seen.  
Then the rest of the unit will be all fun field trips and interviews.  
We'll start by looking at the past of computing by visiting the computer history museum.  
Then we'll look at the present and how you can contribute by visiting SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, and talking to the folks at Mozilla and Benetech.  
Finally we'll get a glimpse into the future of computer by visiting UC Berkley and looking at what people there are doing research on.  
We'll start by summarizing the course, and I want to highlight the three main themes that I think are most important in computing.

abstraction  

단순히 한 종류의 입력을 넣어 결과를 내놓는 게 아니라 abstract한 구조로 (Java abstract class랑 비슷한 느낌) 다양한 입력과 다양한 결과가 나올 수 있음

Engineering, Science, Liberal Art 3개를 예시로 설명하심.
