## 1-5. What is the Web?

1. You start off by typing the URL into your browser.
2. Your computer then sends this request as a packet, which includes the IP address of the website you want.
3. It sends this request through wires, or a satellite which eventually links to wires using your ISP.
4. Your ISP will then re-route the request to the appropriate server location, using the IP address as the guide.
5. Once your request reaches the server, it can send back the website you asked for.
6. However a full website with content is too big to send as a single packet of data.
7. To solve this, the server sends back the website split up into many packets.
8. The packets come with instructions on how to get back to you and reassemble once they reach you.
9. The packets don't care how they get to you, just the final location. (what they really care about is the fastest way to get back to your destination at your home IP address)
10. Once the packets reach you, they are reassembled to show the page.
11. All of this moves at close to the speed of light, so it happens very fast.

There are two main components of a website, 'The Front-End' and 'The Back-End'.

The Front-End : what you see as a user on the website  
The Back-End : the technology used to actually decide what to show you on the Front-End
